In~\cref{sec:mxm1-queue:-expected,sec:mg1} we established the Pollaczek-Khinchine formula for the waiting times of the $M^X/M/1$ queue and the $M/G/1$ queue, respectively.
To compute more difficult performance measures, for instance, the loss probability $\P{L>n}$, we need expressions for the stationary distribution $\pi(n)=\P{L=n}$ of the number of jobs in the system.
Here we present a numerical, recursive, scheme to compute these probabilities.

To find $\pi(n)$, $n=0, 1, \ldots$, we turn again to level-crossing arguments.
However, the reasoning that led to the level-crossing equation~\cref{eq:15} needs to be generalized.
To see this, we consider an example.
If $L(t)=3$, the system contains $3$ items.
(This is not necessarily the same as 3batches.)
Since the server serves single items, down-crossings of level $n=3$ occur in single units.
However, due to the batch arrivals, when a job arrives it typically brings multiple items to the queue.
For instance, suppose that $L(A_k-) = 3$, i.e., job $k$ sees 3 items in the system at its arrival epoch.
If it's size $B_k = 20$, then right after the $k$th arrival the system contains 23 items, that is, $L(A_k)=3+20=23$.
Thus, upon the arrival of job $k$, all levels between states $3$ and $23$ are crossed.

The left panel in~\cref{fig:levelcrossing} shows all up- and down-crossings of some level $n$.
The down-crossing rate is easy: just as in~\cref{fig:A_n_t} there is just one arrow from right to left.
However, level~$n$ can be up-crossed from below from many states, in fact from any level $m, 0\leq m <n$.
More formally, to count the number of up-crossings define
\begin{equation*}
 A(m,n,t) = \sum_{k=1}^{A(t)}\1{L(A_k-) = m}\1{B_k > n-m}
\end{equation*}
as the number of jobs up to time $t$ that see $m$ in the system upon arrival and have batch size larger than $n-m$.
% With this, the total number of times level $n$ is up-crossed up to time~$t$ becomes
% \begin{equation*}
% A(n, t) = \sum_{m=0}^n A(m,n,t).
% \end{equation*}


% Observe that $\1{L(A_k-)\leq n}=1$ only when the $k$th job sees~$n$ or less items in the system, and $\1{L(A_k) > n}=1$ only after the $k$th arrival the system contains more than $n$ items.
% Thus, $\1{L(A_k-) \leq n}\1{ L(A_k)>n}=1$ iff the $k$th arrival generates an up-crossing of level~$n$.

% % Hence
% % \begin{equation*}
% % \sum_{k=1}^{A(t)} \1{L(A_k-) \leq n}\,\1{L(A_k)>n}
% % \end{equation*}
% % counts all up-crossings of level $n$ up to time $t$.


% From~\cref{fig:levelcrossing} we see that an up-crossing can be decomposed into:
% \begin{equation*}
% \begin{split}
% &\1{L(A_k-) \leq n}\1{L(A_k)>n} \\
% &= \1{L(A_k-) =n}\, \1{B_k >0} + \1{L(A_k-) =n-1}\1{ B_k >1} +\cdots + \1{L(A_k-) =0}\1{B_k > n} \\
% &= \sum_{m=0}^n \1{L(A_k-) =m}\1{B_k > n-m}.
% \end{split}
% \end{equation*}
% In other words, sample paths that up-cross level $n$ require that any job that
% sees $m$ ($m\leq n$) in the system upon arrival must bring a batch larger
% than $n-m$ items.



% As a consequence, it is not
% necessarily the case that $|A(n,t) - D(n,t)| \leq 1$ for all $t$, as
% was the case for queueing systems in which jobs arrive as single
% units. We need to generalize this inequality.

\caption{Level crossing of level $n$.
 Observe that when the system is in state $n-2$, the arrival of any batch larger than $2$ ensures that level $n$ is crossed from below.
 The rate at which such events happen is $\lambda \pi(n-2) G(2)$.
 Similarly, in state $n-1$ the arrival of any batch larger than one item ensures that level $n$ is crossed, and this occurs with rate $\lambda \pi(n-1) G(1)$, and so on.

\begin{extra}
 Show that $A(n, n,t) = A(n,t)$, where $A(n,t)$ is defined by~\cref{eq:19}.
\begin{solution}
 $A(n,n,t)$ counts all jobs up to time $t$ that see $n$ items
 and bring at least $n-n+1=1$ unit of work. As each job brings at
 least 1 item, $A(n,n,t)$ counts all jobs that see $n$ items at
 arrival.
\end{solution}
\end{extra}

\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:70}
Assuming that the limits exist, show that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{A(m,n,t)}t = \lambda \pi(m) G(n-m).
\end{equation*}
\begin{solution}
For this purpose, observe that we can write
\begin{equation}\label{eq:16}
 \frac{A(m,n,t)}t = \frac{A(t)}t \frac{A(m,t)}{A(t)}\frac{A(m,n,t)}{A(m,t)}.
\end{equation}
By the assumptions of~\cref{sec:poisson-arrivals-see}, $A(t)/t\to\lambda$ and $A(m,t)/A(t)\to\pi(m)$.
Next, apply the results of~\cref{ex:68} to~\cref{ex:69}.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{extra}\clabel{ex:68}
Provided the limit exists, show that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1332}
\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{A(m,n,t)}{A(m,t)} =\P{B>n-m\given L(A-)=m},
\end{equation}
where the random variable $L(A-)$ denotes the number in the system seen by an arbitrary arrival.
\begin{solution}
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{A(m,n,t)}{A(m,t)} = 
\lim_{t\to\infty} \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{A(t)}\1{L(A_k-) = m, B_k > n-m}}
{\sum_{k=1}^{A(t)}\1{L(A_k-) = m}}=\P{B>n-m\given L(A-)=m},
\end{equation*}
\end{solution}
\end{extra}


\begin{extra}\clabel{ex:69}
Show that $\P{B>n-m\given L(A-)=m}=\P{B>n-m}$.
\begin{hint}
 Realize that $B$ and $L(A-)$ are assumed to be independent.
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
\begin{equation*}
 \begin{split}
\P{B>n-m\given L(A-)=m} &=
\frac{\P{B>n-m,L(A-)=m}}{\P{L(A-)=m}}\\
&=\frac{\P{B>n-m}\P{L(A-)=m}}{\P{L(A-)=m}} \\
&= \P{B>n-m} =G(n-m).
 \end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{solution}
\end{extra}

Equating the number of up- and down-crossing gives $\sum_{m=0}^n A(m,n,t) \approx D(n,t)$. 
Then, dividing by~$t$, taking the limit $t\to\infty$, and using~\cref{ex:70} results in the level-crossing equation for the $M^X/M/1$ queue:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:42}
\lambda \sum_{m=0}^n \pi(m) G(n-m) = \mu \pi(n+1).
\end{equation}

\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:l-153}
Provide an interpretation of~\cref{eq:42} in terms of a thinned Poisson arrival process.
\begin{solution}
 \Cref{eq:16} has the interpretation that the rate at which level $n$ is crossed from below from state $m$ is equal to the rate at which jobs arrive times the fraction of jobs that see $m$ jobs in the system times the fraction of jobs with batch size larger than $n-m$.
 Observe that the stream of jobs with batch size larger than $n-m$ is a Poisson process thinned at rate $G(n-m)$.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{extra}
 Show that~\cref{eq:42} reduces to $\mu \pi(n+1)=\lambda \pi(n)$ for the $M/M/1$ case.
\begin{solution}
 The right-hand side of~\cref{eq:42} is identical, so we only have to concentrate on the left-hand side.
 In the $M/M/1$ queue, all batches have size $1$.
 Thus, $\P{B=1} = f(1)=1$ and $f(k)=0$ for $k\neq 1$.
 Thus, $G(0)=1$ and $G(1)=G(2)=\cdots = 0$.
 Thus, $\sum_{m=0}^n G(n-m) \pi(m) = G(0)\pi(n)=\pi(n)$.
\end{solution}
\end{extra}



It is left to find the normalization constant.
As this recursion does not lead to a closed form expression for $\pi(n)$, such as~\cref{eq:23}, we need to use a criterion to stop this iterative procedure.
Finding general conditions when to stop is not directly easy, but a pragmatic approach is simple.
When the demand is finite, the numbers $\{\pi(k)\}$ should decrease geometrically fast when $k\geq N$ for some (large) $N$\footnote{An interesting question, why should it decrease monotonically after some, large, $N$?}.
Stop when $\pi(N)\ll \pi(0)$, and take $G=\sum_{i=0}^N \pi(i)$ as the normalization constant.
While this is a practical approach, getting formal bounds on a proper size of $N$ requires more work than we can do here.

Once again with $\pi(n)$ we can compute all performance measures we need, and study the influence on the batch size distribution and $\lambda$ and $\mu$ on the system's performance.

\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:l-154}
 Why is~\cref{eq:39}, i.e., $\pi(n)=\delta(n)$, not true for the $M^X/M/1$ batch queue?
 Provide an example.
\begin{solution}
 Because arrivals do not occur in single units, but in batches.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:73}
 Substitute recursion~\cref{eq:42} for $\pi(n)$ into the expression $\E{L} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty n \pi(n)$ and derive~\cref{eq:43}.
\begin{solution}
 We chop this up into two steps, see~\cref{ex:71} and~\cref{ex:72}.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\begin{extra}\clabel{ex:71}
 Step 1 of~\cref{ex:73}.
 Show that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:67}
 \mu \E L =\mu \sum_{n=0}^\infty n \pi(n) = \lambda \frac{\E{B^2}}2 + \lambda \E B \E L +\lambda \frac{\E B}2.
\end{equation}
\begin{hint}
 Substitute the recursion, and carry on with the algebra.
 Use also the results of the exercises of~\cref{sec:mxm1-queue:-expected}.
\end{hint}
\begin{solution}
 We use that $\mu \pi(n) =\lambda \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \pi(i) G(n-1-i)$ and the results of the exercises of~\cref{sec:mxm1-queue:-expected} to see that
\begin{align*}
 \mu \E L
 &=\sum_{n=0}^\infty n\, \mu \pi(n), \quad \text{now substitute for $\mu \pi(n)$ the recursion~\cref{eq:42}}, \\
& =\lambda \sum_{n=0}^\infty n \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \pi(i) G(n-1-i) 
 =\lambda \sum_{n=0}^\infty n \sum_{i=0}^\infty \1{i<n} \pi(i) G(n-1-i) \\
& =\lambda \sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi(i) \sum_{n=0}^\infty \1{i<n} n G(n-1-i) 
 =\lambda \sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi(i) \sum_{n=i+1}^\infty n G(n-1-i) \\
& =\lambda \sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi(i) \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+i+1) G(n) 
 =\lambda \sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi(i) \left[\sum_{n=0}^\infty n G(n) +(i+1) \sum_{n=0}^\infty G(n)\right] \\
 &=\lambda \sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi(i)\sum_{n=0}^\infty n G(n) +\lambda \E B \sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi(i) (i+1) \\ 
 &=\lambda \sum_{i=0}^\infty \pi(i) \frac{\E{B^2} -\E B}2 + \lambda \E B (\E L +1) \\ 
 &= \lambda \frac{\E{B^2} -\E B}2 + \lambda \E B \E L +\lambda \E B \\
 &= \lambda \frac{\E{B^2} }2 + \lambda \E B \E L +\lambda \frac{\E B}2.
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
\end{extra}

\begin{extra}\clabel{ex:72}
 Step 2 of~\cref{ex:73}.
 Use~\cref{eq:67} and the definition $\rho=\lambda \E B/\mu$ to show that
\begin{equation*}
(1- \rho) \E L = \frac{\lambda}\mu \frac{\E{B^2}}2 + \frac\rho2.
\end{equation*}
\begin{solution}
 Dividing both sides of~\cref{eq:67} by $\mu$ and using that $\lambda \E B/\mu = \rho$,
\begin{equation*}
 \E L = \frac{\lambda}{\mu} \frac{\E{B^2}}2 + \rho \E L + \frac\rho2.
\end{equation*}
\end{solution}
\end{extra}



\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:l-155}
 Implement the recursion~\cref{eq:42} in a computer program for the case $f(1)=f(2)=f(3)=1/3$.
 Take $\lambda =1$ and $\mu = 3$.
\begin{solution}
 The recursion for $n$ becomes
\begin{equation*}
\pi(n) = \frac \lambda \mu \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \pi(n-1-i)G(i).
\end{equation*}
Since $G(i) =0$ for $i\geq 3$ we rewrite this to 
\begin{equation*}
 \pi(n) = \frac\lambda \mu \sum_{i=0}^{\min\{n-1,\text{len } G\}} \pi(n-1-i)G(i),
\end{equation*}
where $\text{len } G$ is the largest possible batch size.

The following code carries out the recursion for the $M/M/1$ queue and compares the result to the \emph{unnormalized} probabilities of the $M/M/1$ queue.
Recall, $(\lambda/\mu)^n$ are these unnormalized probabilities.
With this we can test the code right away.

\begin{pyconsole}
import numpy as np

f = [0, 1] # set f[0] = 0
F = np.cumsum(f) # distribution 
G = np.ones_like(F) - F # survivor function

labda = 1
mu = 3
num = 4
p = np.ones(num)

for n in range(1, num):
 p[n] = labda / mu * sum(p[n - 1 - i] * G[i] for i in range(min(n, len(G))))
 print(n, p[n], (labda / mu)**n)

\end{pyconsole}
The test is convincing. So now we'll move on the real problem. 

\begin{pyconsole}
f = np.ones(4) / 3
f[0] = 0
F = np.cumsum(f)
G = np.ones_like(F) - F
num = 30 # stop at 80
p = np.ones(num)
for n in range(1, num):
 p[n] = labda / mu * sum(p[n - 1 - i] * G[i] for i in range(min(n, len(G))))

p /= p.sum() # normalize
\end{pyconsole}

Now that we have the probabilities we can do all experiments we like. 
\begin{pyconsole}
EL = sum(n*p[n] for n in range(len(p)))
EL 
\end{pyconsole}

It is of interest to compare this result to~\cref{eq:43}.
In fact, I spent at least one hour to get~\cref{eq:43} correct; now I can finally check it numerically.


\begin{pyconsole}
EB = sum(k*fk for k,fk in enumerate(f))
rho=labda*EB/mu
EB2 = sum(k*k*fk for k,fk in enumerate(f))
VB = EB2 - EB*EB
C2 = VB/EB/EB
EL = (1+C2)/2*rho/(1-rho)*EB + rho/(1-rho)/2
EL
\end{pyconsole}

So, after all, stopping at 30 is not quite OK: there is a slight difference between the two expectations.
Let's run the recursion up to 100, and see what we get then.

\begin{pyconsole}
num = 100
p = np.ones(num)

for n in range(1, num):
 p[n] = labda / mu * sum(p[n - 1 - i] * G[i] for i in range(min(n, len(G))))

p /= p.sum() # normalize
EL = sum(n*p[n] for n in range(len(p)))
print(EL)
\end{pyconsole}
This does the job.
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


We consider the $M^X/M/1/K$ queue, i.e., a batch queue in which at most $K$ jobs fit into the system.
When customers can be blocked in a batch queue it is necessary to specify a policy that decides which items in a batch to accept.
Three common rules are
\begin{enumerate}
\item Complete rejection: if a batch does not fit entirely into the system, it will be rejected completely.
\item Partial acceptance: accept whatever fits of a batch, and reject the rest.
\item Complete acceptance: accept all batches that arrive when the system contains $K$ or less jobs, and reject the entire batch otherwise.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{exercise}\clabel{ex:l-156}
 Derive a set of recursions, analogous to~\cref{eq:42}, to compute $\pi(n)$ for the $M^X/M/1/K$ queue with complete rejection.
\begin{solution}
 Suppose a batch of size $k$ arrives when the system contains $n$ jobs.
 When $k+n \leq K$, the batch can be accepted since the entire batch will fit into the queue.
 When, however, $k+n> K$, the batch has to be rejected.

 Now consider an imaginary line between states with $n$ and $n+1$ jobs in the system.
 This imaginary line separates the state space into two disjoint parts: one part with states $0, 1, \ldots, n$ and the other part with states $n+1, n+2, \ldots, K$.
 We call this imaginary line `level $n$'.
 We call an `up-crossing' a transition from some state $m\leq n$ to a state $l> n$.
 Likewise, a `down-crossing' of level~$n$ is a transition from some state $l> n$ to some state $m\leq n$.

 If the system contains $n$ jobs, level $n$ is crossed from below with rate $\lambda \pi(n) \P{B \leq K-n}$.
 More generally, when the system is in state $m\leq n$, we need a batch of at least $n+1-m$ to cross level~$n$.
 Moreover, any batch larger than $K-m$ gets rejected.
 Thus, when the system contains $m \leq n $ jobs, the rate at which level $n$ is crossed from below is
 \begin{equation*}
 \lambda \pi(m) \P{n+1-m\leq B \leq K-m} = \lambda \pi(m)
 [G(n-m)-G(K-m)],
 \end{equation*}
where we use that
\begin{align*}
\P{n+1-m\leq B \leq K-m} 
&= \P{B \leq K-m} - \P{B \leq n-m} \\
&= \P{B > n-m} - \P{B > K-m} \\
&= G(n-m)-G(K-m).
\end{align*}

 Since the server serves only single items, level $n$ can only be
 crossed from above from state $n+1$. This happens at rate $\mu p(n+1)$. With PASTA this is equal to $\mu \pi(n+1)$.

 Finally, since in the long run the number of up- and down-crossings must
 be the same, the up- and down-crossing rates must match. This implies
 that the balance equations becomes
 \begin{equation*}
 \mu \pi(n+1) = \lambda \sum_{m=0}^n \pi(m) [G(n-m)-G(K-m)],
 \end{equation*}
 for $n=0,\ldots, K-1$. 

 Before we continue with the other acceptance rules, it is important
 to check this result. In general, off-by-one errors are easily, and
 commonly, made, so we need to test the above on simple cases. 
 \begin{itemize}
 \item If $K\to \infty$, then $G(K-m)=\P{B>K-m}\to 0$, so we get our earlier result. 
 \item Take $n=K$. Then $G(n-m)-G(K-m)=0$ for all $m$. Then the right-hand side is 0, as it should.
 \item Taken $n=0$ and $K=1$, then $\mu \pi(1)= \lambda \pi(0)$. This also makes sense. 
 \item Take $n$ much smaller than $K$. If the batch size is maximally
 $2$, then for small $n$ the entire batch must fit. Let's see if
 this holds in the above formula. If $n$ much smaller than $K$,
 then also $m$ is much smaller than $K$ (since in the right-hand
 size, $m\leq n$). But then $G(K-m) \leq G(2) = 0$, as it
 should. (Observe that $G$ is a decreasing function of its argument;
 its a survival function.)
 \end{itemize}
\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


\begin{extra}
 Derive a set of recursions, analogous to~\cref{eq:42}, to compute $\pi(n)$ for the $M^X/M/1/K$ queue with complete acceptance.
\begin{solution}
 The complete-acceptance policy is actually quite simple. As any
 batch will be accepted when $n\leq K$, the queue length is not
 bounded. Only when the number of jobs in the system is larger than
 $K$, we do not accept jobs. 
 \begin{equation*}
 \mu \pi(n+1) = 
 \begin{cases}
 \lambda \sum_{m=0}^n \pi(m) G(n-m), & \text{ for } n\leq K,\\
 \lambda \sum_{m=0}^K \pi(m) G(n-m), & \text{ for } n> K.
 \end{cases}
 \end{equation*}
\end{solution}
\end{extra}

\begin{extra}
 Derive a set of recursions, analogous to~\cref{eq:42}, to compute $\pi(n)$ for the $M^X/M/1/K$ queue with partial acceptance.
\begin{solution}
 For the partial acceptance case, any job is accepted, but the system only admits whatever fits.
 As level $n\in {0,1,...,K-1}$ is still up-crossed by any batch of size at least $n-m$ when the system is in state $m$, the formula for the up-crossing rate is identical to the case without this acceptance policy.
 Moreover, nothing changes to the formula for the down-crossing rate.
 Hence,
 \begin{equation*}
 \mu \pi(n+1) = \lambda \sum_{m=0}^n \pi(m) G(n-m), 
 \end{equation*}
 for $n=0,1,\ldots, K-1$. 
\end{solution}
\end{extra}


\begin{extra}[Batch services, not obligatory]
 An interesting extension is a queueing process with batch services, i.e., the $M/M^Y/1$ queue.
 Constructing a recursion for the steady-state probabilities $\pi(n)$ for this case is not hard, in fact, mostly analogous to~\cref{eq:42}.
 However, solving the recursion appears to be quite a bit harder.
